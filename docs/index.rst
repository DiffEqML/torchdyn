Torchdyn reference documentation
====================================
(New release 1.0 is out!)

torchdyn is a Python library entirely dedicated to continuous, implicit neural architectures and the numerical methods that underpin them. 

It features a self-contained numerical suite of differential equation and root solvers, including sensitivity methods (continuous backsolve or interpolated adjoints, reverse-mode AD). 
The library further contains a model zoo and an extensive set of tutorials for researchers and practitioners.

.. code:: bash

   pip install torchdyn
