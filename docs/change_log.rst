Change Log
=============


torchdyn 0.1.0 (April 26, 2020)
------------------------------

* First commit

torchdyn 0.1.1 (April 30, 2020)
------------------------------

* Added new tutorial on integral adjoint training for trajectory tracking

torchdyn 0.2.0 (July 3, 2020)
------------------------------

* Introduced new `CNF` `nn.Module` for continuous normalizing flows. CNFs disentangle Jacobian trace computation from data-dynamics, allowing for convenient extension to other variants.
* Introduced `Stable`, `HNN`, `LNN` energy models. These wrap the `func` and handle the additional `autograd` calls, as well as dimension bookkeeping and concatenation.
* Added several new tutorial notebooks
* New static datasets: `gaussians`, `gaussians_spiral`, `diffeqml`.

* Improved `Adjoint` to handle both terminal and integral loss functions simultaneously
* Restructured overall API, including `NeuralDE`
  * `controlled` not a `setting` anymore: introduction of `DataControl` module
  * `order`, `solver`, `atol`, `rtol` are now arguments of `NeuralDE`
* `DEFunc` is now implicitly called inside the NeuralDE class.
* Slimmed down `NeuralDE` management of correct ODE solving call.

* New test suite for `adjoint`, `normalizing flows` and NeuralDE`.
