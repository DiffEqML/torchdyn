NeuralODE / NeuralSDE Classes
==============================

These modules represent the framework necessary for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) or Stochastic
Differential Equations (SDEs) numerically. This is typically the first access point for using `torchdyn`.

These classes can be used as differentiable modules within a larger differentiable numerical program that requires
the solution of ODEs / SDEs.
