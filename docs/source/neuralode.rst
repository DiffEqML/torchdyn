NeuralODE
==========
A `NeuralODE` represents the framework necessary for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) numerically.
This is typically the first access point for using `torchdyn`.

This class can be used when differentiable modules that solve ODEs are needed within a larger differentiable
numerical program
